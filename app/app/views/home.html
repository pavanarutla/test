					<h1>Billboards</h1>

					<p>A billboard is a large outdoor structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy roads. Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers.Typically showing large, seemingly amusing slogans, and distinctive visuals, billboards are highly visible in the top designated market areas.</p>	
					<p>The largest standard-size billboards, known as Bulletins, are located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure(mostly to vehicular traffic). Bulletins afford greatest visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments.</p>
