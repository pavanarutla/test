In addition, you will be subject to late fees. BBA, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information BBA reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at BBA Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your BBA account, you must contact the collection agency directly.
                                Seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on BBA, whether on a web page, mobile app, or otherwise.

                                      <li>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or commitment to buy,</li>
                                      <li>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted),</li>
                                      <li>For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller,</li>

                                      <li>Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers. We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items. If you purchase an item on an BBA site other than BBA.com, you are subject to the User Agreement of that other BBA site with respect to that particular purchase.</li>
                                      <li>You may list your items directly on one or more of BBA's international sites. Additionally, you may direct us to display your listing on BBA sites other than the original BBA listing site, including where you choose to list an item with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping or the Global Shipping Program); the appearance of your listings on these sites is not guaranteed. When you sell your items internationally, you agree to be subject to that other site's User Agreement, policies, and our BBA Money Back Guarantee. You may adjust your account settings within My BBA to indicate your preferences on international shipping by excluding international shipping and applying an exclusion list to the applicable countries.</li>

We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.</li>
