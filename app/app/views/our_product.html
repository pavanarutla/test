						<h1>Billboards</h1>
	
						<p>A billboard is a large outdoor structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic
							areas such as alongside busy roads. Billboards present large advertisements to passing
							pedestrians and drivers.Typically showing large, seemingly amusing slogans, and distinctive
							visuals, billboards are highly visible in the top designated market areas.</p>
						<p>The largest standard-size billboards, known as Bulletins, are located primarily on major
							highways, expressways or principal arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure(mostly
							to vehicular traffic). Bulletins afford greatest visibility due not only to their size, but
							because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments.</p>
						<p>Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and
							secondary arterial roads. Posters are a smaller format than bulletins and are viewed
							principally byresidents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian exposure.</p>
