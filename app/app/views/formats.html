          A billboard is a large outdoor structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy
          roads. Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers. Typically showing large, seemingly
          amusing slogans, and distinctive visuals, billboards are highly visible in the top designated market areas.

        <div class="frt-text">
          The largest standard-size billboards, known as Bulletins, are located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal
          arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). Bulletins afford greatest
          visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments.
        </div>
        <div class="frt-text">
          Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. Posters
          are a smaller format than bulletins and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian
          exposure.

          The largest standard-size billboards, known as Bulletins, are located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal
          arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). Bulletins afford greatest
          visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative "customizing" through extensions and embellishments.

          Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. Posters
