                                <li>If you can't find your listings they may have been removed if they violated one of our policies. However, if you haven't received an email from us about removing your listings, it's possible they're just not ranking high up in search results.</li>
                                <li>To help improve your search ranking, be as descriptive as possible when you create your listings. Write a clear title and description, list your item in the right category, and fill out all item specifics suggested for your item.

                                <h5 class="mt-3">Images and text policy</h5>
                                <li>To make sure you're giving potential buyers an accurate representation of your items, and that you're not infringing on anyone else's content rights, you should write your own descriptions and use your own images, or use any that BBA offers to you from the BBA catalog.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">No item listings policy</h5>
                                <li>All listings on BBA have to offer a physical item or a tangible service. Listings that are blank, or don't offer a tangible item or service, aren't allowed because they can cause confusion for buyers and increase the risk of fraud.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Search and browse manipulation policy</h5>
                                <li>Learn why it's not allowed to manipulate BBA's search and browse experience by adding popular keywords in your listings that don't have any relation to your items.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Item location misrepresentation policy</h5>
                                <li>To make sure buyers have a clear understanding of shipping charges and delivery times, all sellers must provide clear and accurate information in their listings about where their item is located.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Warranties policy</h5>
                                <li>Offering your customers a guarantee or warranty gives them peace of mind when they buy from you, and can help give you an edge on the competition.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">JavaScript policy</h5>
                                <li>Active content in listings can create a poor experience by increasing page load times and introducing security risks. That's why it's not allowed in listings on BBA.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Links policy</h5>
                                <li>Find out why we don't allow listings to contain links that direct customers to a site other than BBA.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Third-party endorsements policy</h5>
                                <li>Understand why we don't allow the use of third-party statements or logos that vouch for a seller's 'reputation' or 'trustworthiness' in BBA listings.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Duplicate listings policy</h5>
                                <li>Only one fixed price listing of an identical item can be listed at the same time, from the same seller. This is to ensure buyers see a wide variety of options from multiple sellers.</li>
                                <h5 class="mt-3">Pre-sale listings policy</h5>
                                <li>To ensure buyers aren't disappointed, our pre-sale listings policy for items like cell phones and video games outlines the requirements for this type of transaction.</li>
